### Qualle
/kwɑːl.i/ quall-e
jellyfish

'Qualle' the german word for jellyfish, perfectly represents what I strive to achieve with my projects.

Jellyfish are known for their adaptability, resilience and fluidity. Inspired by this symbolism I aim to create products and solutions that empower you to navigate your digital landscape effortlessly, achieving success in a flow-like state.
